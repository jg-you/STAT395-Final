# STAT395 Final Deliverable


# NBA Passing Network

## Overview
The accompanying data set provided is in the format of a `.graphml file`, called nba_network.graphml. The cleaned data sources to create this `.graphml` file are `player_statistics.csv` (node/player attributes) and `player_passes.csv` (edges/passes between players). These cleaned `.csv` files are generated by `create_datasets.py` which utilizes the files `player_passing_data.json` and the three `.csv` files: `PerPossData.csv`, `TouchData.csv`, and `ShootingData.csv`. The file `player_passing_data.json` was scraped using the script `nba_network_scraping.py` and the other three `.csv` files were scraped using `nba_stats_scraping.py`.
