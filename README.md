# NBA Passing Network

## Overview
The accompanying data set provided is in the format of a `.graphml file`, called nba_network.graphml. The cleaned data sources to create this `.graphml` file are `player_statistics.csv` (node/player attributes) and `player_passes.csv` (edges/passes between players). These cleaned `.csv` files are generated by `create_datasets.py` which utilizes the files `player_passing_data.json` and the three `.csv` files: `PerPossData.csv`, `TouchData.csv`, and `ShootingData.csv`. The file `player_passing_data.json` was scraped using the script `nba_network_scraping.py` and the other three `.csv` files were scraped using `nba_stats_scraping.py`.


## Source
All data was scraped from NBA.com. To gather passing data between players, each team was iterated through, then each player on that team, and teh passing data was collected. Here is an example of the passing data gathered (scraped by `nba_network_scraping.py`) for each player: https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629628/passes-dash?SeasonType=Regular+Season. NBA.com has an abundance of data tables available, for example https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional?SeasonType=Regular+Season, which `nba_stats_scraping.py` can scrape. 

## Data Description
- **Graph Type:** Directed-Weighted Network where direction is direction of pass, and weight is teh frequency at which that pass is made
- **Number of Nodes (Players):** 490
- **Number of Edges:** 5561
- **Node Attributes:** The node (player) attributes consist of 55 variables, many of them giving per game statistics, while others offer per possesion statistics (which in essence can act as a probability of certain actions bein taken). 

## Usage
As alluded to, I have a clear use for this data set in mind. Each team in the NBA can be considered its own network, with each layer having statistically driven probabilites of performing certain actions, such as shooting, passing, dribbling, and then further attributes giving probabilites of success/failure on each action. These NBA team passing networks have the potential to be used as the basis of an accurate, data-driven, and truly explainable predictive model of NBA game outcomes.
