# STAT395 Final Deliverable


# NBA Passing Network

## Overview
The accompanying data set provided is in the format of a `.graphml file`, called nba_network.graphml. The cleaned data sources to create this `.graphml` file are `player_statistics.csv` (node/player attributes) and `player_passes.csv` (edges/passes between players). These cleaned `.csv` files are generated by `create_datasets.py` which utilizes the files `player_passing_data.json` and the three `.csv` files: `PerPossData.csv`, `TouchData.csv`, and `ShootingData.csv`. The file `player_passing_data.json` was scraped using the script `nba_network_scraping.py` and the other three `.csv` files were scraped using `nba_stats_scraping.py`.


## Source
All data was scraped from NBA.com. To gather passing data between players, each team was iterated through, then each player on that team, and teh passing data was collected. Here is an example of the passing data gathered (scraped by `nba_network_scraping.py`) for each player: https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629628/passes-dash?SeasonType=Regular+Season. NBA.com has an abundance of data tables available, for example https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional?SeasonType=Regular+Season, which `nba_stats_scraping.py` can scrape.

- **Number of Nodes (Players):** 490
- **Number of Edges:** 5561
- **Node Attributes:**

## Usage
Any potential use cases for the dataset, along with any relevant applications or fields.
